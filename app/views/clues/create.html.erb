Hi<%= @name %>! Don't worry, your secret is safe with me.

We have just created a new clue, so theoretically we should be able to make a GET request to see it. Make that GET request to the UUID you just created the clue with: /<%=@clue.uuid%>. What do you see in the body here?

I've added some extra information to the clue to help you continue the hunt.
